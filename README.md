# JB's Record Store

JB's Record Store is a small-scale B2C e-commerce store selling physical music albums on LP, CD and Cassette. The site is targeted towards users who are interested in music and building their physical music collection, an industry that's experienced a major revival over the past number of years. 

Users can browse and purchase a range of music based on their interests. They can browse the store by either format (CD, LP or Cassete) or by musical genre - options for both are available from the main site navigation. They can also read reviews left by other users of the site, and can reach out to the site administrator if needed, either through the site Contact form or else via the store's social media accounts.

The store uses Stripe to handle payments. As this site was built for educational purposes, please do not enter any live card details into the checkout page. For testing purposes, Stripe's test card details can be used - you can find a link to these details in Stripe's documentation [here](https://stripe.com/docs/testing#cards).
